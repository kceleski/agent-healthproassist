## Project Architecture

HealthProAssist utilizes a modular, scalable architecture based on modern fullstack best practices:

- **Frontend:** Built with React, Vite, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS. The UI leverages shadcn/ui component library for accessible, beautiful components and Lucide icons for consistent iconography.
- **Routing & State:** Uses React Router DOM for SPA navigation and @tanstack/react-query for data fetching and server-side state management.
- **Authentication:** Handles user authentication and session management through Supabase.
- **Backend:** Supabase (hosted PostgreSQL database, managed API, Auth) acts as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform.
- **AI Integration:** Features conversational AI using OpenAI's Assistant API, with responses rendered visually using D-ID's talking avatar technology.
- **Deployment:** Ready for zero-config deployment on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting service.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with Typescript): Main UI framework
- **Vite:** Blazing-fast developer server and build tool
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI styling
- **shadcn/ui:** Headless, accessible components for React
- **Lucide-react:** SVG icon library
- **@tanstack/react-query:** Data fetching and caching
- **Supabase:** Managed backend services (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **OpenAI Assistant API:** Conversational AI engine
- **D-ID API:** Talking avatar integration for dynamic AI responses
- **Sonner:** For toast notifications and feedback

**Other utilities:**
- `react-hook-form`, `zod`: For form management and schema validation
- `date-fns`: Modern date utility library
